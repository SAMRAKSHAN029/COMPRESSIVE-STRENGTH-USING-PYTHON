# COMPRESSIVE-STRENGTH-USING-PYTHON
To find compressive strength of brick using python def compressive_strength(max_load, length, width): """ Calculate the compressive strength of a brick.

Parameters:
max_load (float): The maximum load at which the brick fails (in Newtons).
length (float): The length of the brick (in mm).
width (float): The width of the brick (in mm).

Returns:
float: Compressive strength of the brick (in N/mm²).

return compressive_strength
